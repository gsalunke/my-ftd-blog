-- ds.page: Design the Ultimate Blog Homepage

For blogs, a user’s [first impression is key](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-long-do-users-stay-on-web-pages/). If visitors can’t determine [credibility](http://credibility.stanford.edu/), navigate easily or connect with 
the content, they are less likely to subscribe or return.

The primary job of a blog is to deliver content to a distinct 
audience. In staying true to the topic, the blog must also meet
the challenge of attracting the target reader’s attention and relate 
to their point of view.

All of these factors are typically handled through design. Naturally, 
the color palette, imagery, logo placement and style most prominently 
communicate a blog’s personality andtopic. However, the best blogs are 
not the most visually stunning, but the most relevant and functional.
